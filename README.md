# Low-Poly-Racer

## About the game
This game is a racing game. Currently the player can only play alone. There is a drifting mechanic which helps the player to gather boost whilst drifting. I started to develop an AI so that the player can race against them but the AI hasn't reached it's peak yet and needs a lot of optimizing.  

This game was created by following a Youtube series. Most of the scripts has been changed later on. I coded my own wheel collider and car controller scripts based on my researches on the internet.

## Models
The models where created by me following the same Youtube series.

## Planned Features
- Better AI
- Add Power ups
