# Low-Poly-Racer

## About the game
This game is a racing game. Currently the player can only play alone. The player can gather boost whilst drifting. I started to develop an AI so that the player can race against them. The AI hasn't reached it's peak yet and needs a lot of optimizing.  

I started to create this game following a Youtube series but then changed most of the scripts to change the car behaviour. I coded my own wheel collider and car controller scripts based on my researches.

## Planned Features
- Better AI
- Add Power ups
